title: Will certifactions/certificates help your career?
---

You’ve probably heard from someone certificates or certifications is the way to boost your career. But do they actually help?

It wouldn’t surprise me if everyone reading this considered it as an option at some point, whether to stay competitive in the job market, improve your pay, or break into a new industry. Honestly the answer depends.

## Certificates vs. Certifications

First, it helps to understand the difference:

- **Certificate:** A document you receive after completing a course. It does not always mean you passed a difficult exam or met strict standards. Examples include LinkedIn Learning, Coursera, or Google Career Certificates.  
- **Certification:** A verified credential from an organization recognized across an industry. You usually have to pass a proctored test to earn it. Examples include PMP, SHRM, CPA, or financial licenses.  

Because certifications involve formal testing and external validation, they usually carry more weight with managers and leadership. That said, certificates are not useless, and certifications are not a guaranteed ticket to career success.

## When Certifications Are Worth It

When chosen carefully, certifications can return your investment of time and effort. They are most valuable when they:

1. **Help you meet real employer or industry requirements**  
   If a certification is a requirement for a role, it will almost certainly provide return, assuming you also meet other requirements such as relevant experience.

2. **Strengthen your credibility in a specific field**  
   Credibility is subjective, and a certification is not guaranteed to push you over the edge. However, in most cases it provides an advantage. For example, a PMP certification signals project management expertise to leadership and can make you stand out. 

3. **Equip you with practical skills that transfer into your day to day work**  
   Being able to perform at a high level, whether to maintain your current role or advance your career, pays itself back over time. Even if leadership does not explicitly require certification, applying the skills to stand out can generate long-term value and create opportunities.

## When Certificates Are Worth It

Certificates may be easier to earn than certifications, but when chosen strategically, they can also return value to your career. Their value comes from several areas:

1. **Conversation starters in interviews**  
   Certificates do not replace hands on experience. Their main value is opening a conversation in interviews. They become especially effective when paired with a portfolio or examples that show the skills you gained and how they can be applied. Doing this helps hiring managers picture you performing the work. At best, it convinces them that you are capable and proficient; at worst, it shows you are proactive and willing to learn.

2. **Demonstration of initiative and commitment**  
   Many people do not actively work on themselves or invest time in learning new skills. By completing a certificate, you signal that you are motivated, proactive, and committed to bettering yourself. It gives you a concrete example of initiative to discuss in interviews and shows that you take your career seriously.

3. **Filling a skill gap**  
   Certificates allow you to learn targeted skills that your current experience may not cover. They can help you become immediately more effective in your work and stronger as a candidate. Often, certificate programs include projects or exercises that you can showcase in your portfolio or discuss during interviews.

## How I Will Leverage My Google Certificate

To give an example, here is how I plan to leverage my recently earned project management certificate. As part of the course, I completed a portfolio project that includes project documents, notes on my learnings, and key decisions I made. I will integrate these into my website so they are easy to share when applying for jobs or to bring them to interviews. I have also prepared a narrative explaining how this portfolio complements my existing project experience.

By providing a visual example of my work, I can more concretely establish my credibility and ability. I do not expect this certificate to be the sole reason I land a job, but combined with my work history, it can help me secure conversations where I can sell my overall character rather than a 1-dimensional candidate.

## Takeaways

At the end of the day, experience is king. However, certificates and certifications can still help advance your career when used for the right reasons. They are tools to fill skill gaps, demonstrate initiative, strengthen credibility, and provide concrete examples of your abilities. When combined with real world experience, they can help you stand out, start meaningful conversations with hiring managers, and ultimately support your career goals.
