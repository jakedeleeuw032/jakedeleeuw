I always loved building and breaking things, but I doubted myself if I had anything worth sharing with the world until recently. Now I strive to showcase my work and thoughts to help someone else who might walk the same footsteps as me one day and save them the effort.

**My goals:**

My first goal is to **launch my first mobile app start to finish** and have it published on app stores. Throughout the process I hope to document my success and challenges here to give you a better insight of what it takes to go **0->1**.

I am not a programmer by trade and don’t aim to be an expert either. But with how AI is evolving, I think it’s more important than ever to understand what is going on in the tech world and how to master the new technologies being built. 

Therefore, my second goal is to be able to understand and do these things at a high level view:

•	**Professional Tooling & Version Control Mastery**

•	**Core Programming Logic and How It Interacts**

•	**Code Quality Assurance (Unit Testing & Documentation)**

•	**Project Architecture & Systems Thinking**

•	**API Integration & Connectivity**

•	**What safe and responsible code looks like**

•	**Vibe coding/AI assisted strategies**

My thesis is that if I can get a grasp on these core concepts. I can have the information I need to build what I want and to have the right conversations to ship my ideas as AI continues to become more powerful.
