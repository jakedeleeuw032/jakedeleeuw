## **About me** 

I always loved building and breaking things, but I doubted myself if I had anything worth sharing with the world until recently. Now I strive to showcase my work and thoughts to help someone else who might walk the same footsteps and be the guiding light I never had.

## **My Goals**

### Goal 1: Launch my first mobile app

Launching an app that I can call my own and see people use is a dream of mine. My current idea is a gym based portfolio app that I am actively working on. Stay tuned in the posts to see it go from 0->1 and the sucesses and challenges while devolping it. 

### Goal 2: Cultivate coding/AI proficentcy

I want to understand and perform these skills at a high level view: 

•	**Professional Tooling & Version Control Mastery**

•	**Core Programming Logic and How It Interacts**

•	**Code Quality Assurance (Unit Testing & Documentation)**

•	**Project Architecture & Systems Thinking**

•	**API Integration & Connectivity**
 
•	**What safe and responsible code looks like**

•	**Vibe coding/AI assisted strategies**

### Goal 3: Become a better project manager 

Being early in my career I still have a lot to learn inside of my main skillset of project management. I hope to share insights of tools that work well, interpersonal skills, and how to overcome challenges. This goal is a little harder to document and share due to confidentiality, but I will at the very least show what I learn in my free time.
